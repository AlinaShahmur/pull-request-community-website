# Contributing To Pull Request Website
Thank you, it is not obvious that you are devoting your time to contributing to the community and we appreciate that.‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª

To make your experience as pleasant and easy as possible, please follow this guide.

## The Ways You Can Contribute To The Pull Request Website:
* Open an [new issue](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Community/pull-request-community-website/issues/new) with a bug or a feature proposal.
* Add documentaion.
* Improve our tests.
* Solve an issue or add a feature - feel free to choose an issue from the [open issues list](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Community/pull-request-community-website/issues) and ask to take it.

## The Preferred Way To Contribute:
1. Pick issue from the [issues list](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Community/pull-request-community-website/issues) or [open new issue](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Community/pull-request-community-website/issues/new) and *ask* in the comment to take the task.
2. Wait for the maintainer's approval. Keep in mind that they do not have to approve it for you. Like we said at the start, communication is everything.
3. Fork the project. For more details, read this article: [My first contribution to open source: Make a fork of the repo / Galen Corey](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/first-open-source-contribution-fork-clone).
4. Clone the forked project to your local machine (see instructions below). 
5. Try to brake the task to subtasks.
6. Open branch (see instructions below).
7. Work on the issue, feel free to ask any questions you want in the issue.
8. Open pull request (make sure you open the PR to the original project).
9. Make sure all the tests pass.
10. Merge to master.

## Working On Issue:
Communication is the most difficult problem in open source, so please don't work freestyle. 
Instead, choose an issue from the [open issues list](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Community/pull-request-community-website/issues) or [open one](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Community/pull-request-community-website/issues/new) with all the details needed to make sure we understand each other.

## Developing In a Branch:
Please make sure you follow this list:
1) Link your branch to the relevant issue.
 Do you not know how to connect branch to issue? no problem, follow this [guid](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) 
2) Create a meaningful names for commits.
3) Create small commits that connect one logic unit at a time.
4) Use [tasks list](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-task-lists) to manage your work.
